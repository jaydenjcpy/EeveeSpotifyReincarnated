/// A small floating button shown on top of the Now Playing screen
/// whenever word-synced (karaoke) data is available for the current
/// track — this is the visible, discoverable way to open the karaoke
/// view, replacing the previous behavior where the *only* trigger was an
/// undocumented 0.5s long-press anywhere on screen (KaraokeGestureTrigger,
/// which still works as a shortcut once you know about it, but isn't
/// something a user would ever stumble onto).
///
/// Visibility is primarily driven by polling rather than a
/// viewDidAppear/viewWillDisappear hook on some specific Now Playing view
/// controller class. The Now Playing experience here is a single
/// UICollectionView hosting Now Playing/Lyrics/Queue as swipeable pages
/// within ONE container view controller (see
/// NowPlayingScrollViewController.swift / NPVScrollViewController.swift's
/// `collectionView()` — confirmed by NowPlayingScrollPrivateService
/// ImplementationHook in NowPlayingScrollViewControllerInstanceHook.x.swift,
/// which is what actually populates the `nowPlayingScrollViewController`/
/// `npvScrollViewController` globals this file reads), not a stack of
/// separately-lifecycled per-page view controllers — so there's no single
/// "page appeared" callback to hook for THAT screen. Checking whether that
/// already-tracked collection view currently has a non-nil `.window` is a
/// simple, reliable stand-in: it's true exactly when the Now Playing
/// screen (in any of its swiped-to pages) is actually on screen, false
/// otherwise, and it reuses infrastructure
/// (`nowPlayingScrollViewController`/`npvScrollViewController`) that's
/// already proven to populate reliably elsewhere in this codebase.
///
/// Spotify's separate native Lyrics *fullscreen* screen (a distinct pushed/
/// presented view controller, not one of the swiped-to pages above) is the
/// one exception: KaraokeButtonOverlayLyricsScreenHook watches that
/// screen's own appear/disappear and force-hides this button while it's
/// up, since the button belongs on the page where the music plays, not
/// the Lyrics page.
///
/// Implemented as a separate UIWindow (rather than injecting a UIView
/// into Spotify's own Encore view hierarchy, the way
/// CustomLyrics+ShowAttributes.x.swift does for the credits footer) so it
/// doesn't depend on Now Playing's internal layout at all. The window's
/// frame is sized to just the button's own corner — NOT the full screen —
/// positioned near the bottom action row (best-effort proximity to
/// Spotify's own share button; see the comment above ensureWindowExists
/// for why this isn't a true anchor to it). A UIWindow only ever receives
/// touches that land within its own frame, so this is what lets every tap
/// *outside* that corner reach Spotify's window untouched, with no custom
/// hitTest logic needed at all. (An earlier version made this window
/// full-screen and tried to manually pass non-button touches through via
/// a hitTest override — that didn't work, because SwiftUI's hosting view
/// does its own internal touch routing and hands back *itself* as the
/// hit-test result for essentially any point inside it, so the "is this
/// actually empty space, or a real button" check could never tell the
/// difference.)
