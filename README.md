## The History

In January 2024, Spotilife, the only tweak to get Spotify Premium, stopped working on new Spotify versions. [whoeevee](https://github.com/whoeevee) decompiled Spotilife, reverse-engineered Spotify, intercepted requests, etc., and created EeveeSpotify.

In August 2025, the original EeveeSpotify repository was disabled following a [DMCA takedown](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2025/08/2025-08-14-spotify.md) by Spotify.

In December 2025, whoeevee, the maintainer of the EeveeSpotify tweak at the time, announced he would be discontinuing the tweak because of the burden of keeping up with Spotify's constantly changing architectures. Soon after, [Skye (@Meeep1)](https://github.com/Meeep1) forked the original Eevee repo and continued developing the tweak to support newer Spotify versions, under the project name EeveeSpotifyRevivedPublic.

In March 2026, users of the latest EeveeSpotifyRevivedPublic release (v9.1.28) experienced constant logout issues and reported them to Skye, but EeveeSpotifyRevivedPublic hadn't released any newer updates. During March, I was constantly annoyed by the logout issue and decided to take matters into my own hands: I forked EeveeSpotifyRevivedPublic, fixed the logout issue, and that fork eventually became this repository — **EeveeSpotifyReincarnated** — continuing the legacy of EeveeSpotify for newer versions of Spotify.

Today, EeveeSpotifyReincarnated is maintained by [jaydenjcpy](https://github.com/jaydenjcpy), [faroukbmiled](https://github.com/faroukbmiled), and [Mod4](https://github.com/M0d-4), keeping the tweak alive as Spotify keeps changing.



## Restrictions

Please refrain from opening issues about the following features, as they are server-sided and will **NEVER** work:

- Very High audio quality
- Native playlist downloading (you can download podcast episodes though)
- Jam (hosting a Spotify Jam and joining it remotely requires Premium; only joining in-person works)
- AI DJ/Playlist
- Spotify Connect (When using Spotify Connect, the device will act as a remote control and stream directly to the connected device. This is a server-sided limitation and is beyond the control of EeveeSpotify, so it will behave as if you have a Free subscription while using this feature.)

## Lyrics Support

EeveeSpotify replaces Spotify monthly limited lyrics with one of the following four lyrics providers:

- Genius: Offers the best quality lyrics, provides the most songs, and updates lyrics the fastest. Does not and will never be time-synced.

- LRCLIB: The most open service, offering time-synced lyrics. However, it lacks lyrics for many songs.

- Musixmatch: The service Spotify uses. Provides time-synced lyrics for many songs, but you'll need a user token to use this source. To obtain the token, download Musixmatch from the App Store, sign up, then go to Settings > Get help > Copy debug info, and paste it into EeveeSpotify alert. You can also extract the token using MITM.

- PetitLyrics: Offers plenty of time-synced Japanese and some international lyrics.

If the tweak is unable to find a song or process the lyrics, you'll see a "Couldn't load the lyrics for this song" message. The lyrics might be wrong for some songs when using Genius due to how the tweak searches songs. While I've made it work in most cases, kindly refrain from opening issues about it.

## How It Works

EeveeSpotify intercepts Spotify requests to load user data, deserializes it, and modifies the parameters in real-time. This method works incredibly stable across supported Spotify versions.

The tweak also sets `trackRowsEnabled` to `true`, allowing you to see track rows and liked tracks on artist pages just like with Premium.

## Installation

For sideloaded IPAs, we recommend using **SideStore** or certificate-based signing tools like **Ksign** for best compatibility.

To open Spotify links in sideloaded app, use [OpenSpotifySafariExtension](https://github.com/BillyCurtis/OpenSpotifySafariExtension). Remember to activate it and allow access in Settings > Safari > Extensions.

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening issues or pull requests.

Contributions are welcome — bug fixes, new features, and translations alike. If you'd like to translate the tweak into your language or improve an existing localization, see [TRANSLATING.md](TRANSLATING.md) for the workflow, the rules, and the `Tools/l10n_lint.py` checker that validates your translation before you open a PR.
